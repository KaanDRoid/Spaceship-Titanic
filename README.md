This repository provides a complete and detailed analysis pipeline for the **Spaceship Titanic** Kaggle competition. Our aim was to accurately predict whether passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension following a spacetime anomaly.

## 🌌 **About the Competition**
In the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic experienced a mysterious event during its voyage, resulting in nearly half the passengers being transported to another dimension. Using recovered data, our task was to predict which passengers faced this extraordinary fate.

## 📚 **Project Overview**
The notebook covers an extensive data science pipeline including:

- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
  - Investigating missing data
  - Exploring feature distributions
  - Data visualization for insights

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Creating new features (Group Size, Cabin information, Total Spending, Spending Behavior)

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - Random Forest 🌳
  - XGBoost 🚀
  - CatBoost 🐱
  - LightGBM ⚡
  - PyTorch Neural Network 🧠

- **Ensemble Methods:**
  - Combining individual models using a soft-voting ensemble to enhance prediction accuracy

- **Submission:**
  - Final predictions formatted for Kaggle submission

## 🏅 **Results**
- Achieved an accuracy ranking of **157th place** among **1,866 participants** and **1,827 teams**.
